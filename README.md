### Calculator Web App (Archived)
## Overview

This project is a simple calculator web application built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It was created as a learning exercise to practice core front-end development concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic application logic.

The project is now archived and is no longer actively maintained. It remains available as a reference for learning progress and experimentation.

## Purpose

The main goals of this project were to:

Learn and practice vanilla JavaScript

Understand DOM manipulation and event listeners

Implement basic application state and logic

Gain familiarity with structuring a small web project

This app was not intended for production use, but rather as a hands-on learning tool.

## Features

Basic arithmetic operations:

- Addition

- Subtraction

- Multiplication

- Division

Clear/reset functionality

Button-based input

Simple, clean user interface

## Technologies Used

- HTML – Structure and layout

- CSS – Styling and visual layout

- JavaScript – Calculator logic and interactivity

No external libraries or frameworks were used.

## How It Works

The calculator operates by:

1. Capturing user input through button click events

2. Updating the display dynamically using the DOM

3. Storing the current operation and operands in JavaScript variables

4. Evaluating the expression when requested and displaying the result

## Running the Project

To run the calculator locally:

Clone or download this repository

Open the index.html file in any modern web browser

No build steps or dependencies are required.

## Project Status

📦 Archived

This project is no longer under active development. It is preserved as a snapshot of an earlier learning stage and may not reflect best practices or optimal solutions.

### Possible Improvements (Not Implemented)

Keyboard input support

Improved error handling (e.g., division by zero)

Better accessibility

Refactored logic for readability and scalability

Responsive design enhancements
